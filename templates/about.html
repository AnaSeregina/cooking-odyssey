      <h2>About Cooking Odyssey</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Cooking Odyssey — a joyful journey through the flavors of life!</p>

      <h3>A Retro-Future Dream</h3>
      <p>Inspired by the boundless optimism of the 1950s and 60s, Cooking Odyssey blends retro-futuristic charm with the timeless delight of home-cooked meals. Back then, the future looked bright, colorful, and full of possibilities — just like the recipes you'll find here.
      </p>
      <h3>A Personal Recipe Collection</h3>
      <p>It all started with a simple idea: I needed a place to gather my favorite recipes. A book seemed too ordinary, and formal recipe sites felt too serious. That's when it struck me: why not create something fun, happy, and entirely my own? Thus, Cooking Odyssey was born — a joyful collection of delicious meals.
      </p>
      <h3>More Than Just Recipes</h3>
      <p>Here, every dish isn't just about food — it's about sparking happiness. Each recipe carries a touch of positivity, designed to bring a smile to your face while inspiring you to cook, taste, and explore. Think of it as cooking with a side of good vibes!
      </p>
